This time, I re-create one of my old app that I create in "Game Maker 8", by using "Python"

You can find the old one here : [Secret Image Maker](https://gmindo.forumid.net/t1267-secret-image-maker)

This app can hide files in image ([steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)), like compressed files in zip, but this one hidden in image

There will be Secret Image Opener "Python" version too (if I'm in the mood for it), but for now just use the old opener in "Game Maker 8"


*I'm using [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/) for gui, [WxFormBuilder](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/) for designing gui and [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) for zipping files
